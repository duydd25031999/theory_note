# Things to avoid when asking questions

## Leading questions: Câu hỏi dẫn dắt
- Questions that only have a particular response
- ➔ Question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

- Câu hỏi chỉ có một câu trả lời cụ thể
- Câu hỏi đã gợi ý câu trả lời trong đó
- Câu hỏi trong tình huống chỉ có thể trả lời theo 1-2 cách

    > Example: This product is too expensive, isn’t it?

    - This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. 

    - A better question might be **What is your opinion of this product?**

    - There are tons of answers to that question.
    - they could include information
        - usability
        - features
        - accessories (phụ kiện)
        - color
        - reliability
        - popularity
        - on top of price

## Closed-ended questions: Câu hỏi đóng

- Questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only
- ➔ Câu trả lời cần có nhiều thông tin.

- Câu hỏi chỉ trả lời = 1 từ hoặc câu trả lời ngắn gọn
- Lhông khuyến khích mọi người mở rộng câu trả lời của họ.

    > Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?

    - This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer.
    - Họ thực sự dễ dàng đưa ra những câu trả lời chỉ một từ mà không có nhiều thông tin.

    - A better question might be **What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.**

    - This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

## Vague questions: Câu hỏi mơ hồ

- Questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context
- ➔ These questions give context (data entry) 
    - help frame responses that are measurable.
- Các câu hỏi không cụ thể hoặc không cung cấp ngữ cảnh, tình huống cụ thể
    > Example: Does the tool work for you?
    - This question is too vague because there is no context.
    -  Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know.
    - A better inquiry might be
        - **When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool?**
        - **If faster, how much time is saved?**
        - **If slower, how much time is lost?**
    - These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).

# Highly effective questions are SMART questions

## SMART questions

- 1 câu hỏi chứa >= 1 yếu tố SMART
- Không phải lúc nào câu hỏi cũng dài + thừa dữ kiện
1. <b class="text-special">S</b>pecific
    - Specific questions 
        - simple
        - significant

    ```
    - Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of action plan?
    (CÂU TRẢ LỜI có cung cấp thông tin giúp bạn đề ra một số loại kế hoạch hành động không?)
    ```

    - What ..., which ... mà hành động ... ảnh hưởng ?

1. <b class="text-special">R</b>elevant: liên quan, thích hợp

    - Hỏi về những thứ liên quan tới solution
    - Không phải hỏi vu vơ về problem

    ```
    - Is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve?
      (Có phải CÂU HỎI về vấn đề cụ thể mà bạn đang cố gắng giải quyết không?)
    ```

1. <b class="text-special">T</b>ime-bound
    - Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied
    - Hỏi về khoảng thời gian thu thập, xử lý data
    - Càng chỉ rõ thời điểm, càng rút ngắn khoảng thời gian ➔ càng có ích

      (CÂU TRẢ LỜI có phù hợp với thời gian cụ thể để nghiên cứu không?)
    ```

## Right type of questions

## Fairness 
- ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias (thiên vị). 

## Problem question
- Problem question ➔ breaks down ➔ one or more SMART questions
- Questions should be **open-ended** (kết thúc mở)

    > What features do people look for when buying a new car?

    - Process 
        - **Specific**: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?

        - **Measurable**: Does the question include a feature rating system?

        - **Action-oriented**: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?

        - **Relevant**: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?

        - **Time-bound**: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years? 

    - Output
        - On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?

        - What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?

        - What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?

        - How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?

        - Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?

# Self-Reflection

## Exanple 1

### The scenario
- You are three weeks into your new job as a junior data analyst. 

- The company you work for has just collected data on their weekend sales. 

- Your manager asks you to perform a “deep dive” into this data. 

- To get this project started, you must ask some questions and get some information.

### Reflection

1. Based on the SMART framework, which questions are most important to ask?

1. How will these questions clarify the requirements and goals for the project?

1. How does asking detailed, specific questions benefit you when planning for a project? Can vague or unclear questions harm a project?

### Response 

<span class="text-underline">Question 1</span>:
- When is the project due?
    - Type: Time
    - SMART: <b class="tooltip" title="Specific">S</b> + <b class="tooltip" title="Measuable">M</b> + <b class="tooltip" title="Action-oriented">A</b>
 
- Are there any specific challenges to keep in mind? 
    - Type: Objective
    - SMART: <b class="tooltip" title="Specific">S</b> + <b class="tooltip" title="Action-oriented">A</b>

- Who are the major stakeholders for this project?
    - Type: Audience
    - SMART: <b class="tooltip" title="Specific">S</b> + <b class="tooltip" title="Relevant">R</b>

- What do the major stakeholders expect this project to do for them?
    - Type: Objective
    - SMART: <b class="tooltip" title="Specific">S</b> + <b class="tooltip" title="Action-oriented">A</b>

- Who am I presenting the results to?
    - Type: Audience
    - SMART: <b class="tooltip" title="Specific">S</b> + <b class="tooltip" title="Action-oriented">A</b>

<span class="text-underline">Question 2</span>:
- These questions can help you focus on techniques and analyses that produce results of interest to stakeholders. They also clarify the deliverable’s due date, which is important to know so you can manage your time effectively. When you start work on a project, you need to ask questions that align with the plan and the goals and help you explore the data. The more questions you ask, the more you learn about your data, and the more powerful your insights will be.

<span class="text-underline">Question 3</span>:
- Asking thorough and specific questions means clarifying details until you get to concrete requirements. With clear requirements and goals, it’s much easier to plan and execute a successful data analysis project and avoid time-consuming problems down the road.

## Example 2

### The scenario
- In this activity, you will have a data conversation with someone you know. 
- This can be in person, over the phone, or in a video chat. 
- Choose someone in your life who uses data to make better decisions. 
- This might be a family member who runs a small business, a friend who leads a committee for the Parent Teacher Association, or a neighbor who teaches piano lessons. 
- All of these people turn to data in some way to be more effective in their roles.
- Let them know you're training to be a data analyst, and would like to have a chat about data to practice your skills asking questions. 
- By the end of this conversation, you'll end up with some useful insights that will benefit both of you.

### Plan for the conversation

### Reflection

- What SMART questions did you ask? How did these questions tie into the field of the person you chatted with? 

- What insights did you discover during your conversation? 

- How did the SMART framework help you arrive at your conclusions?
