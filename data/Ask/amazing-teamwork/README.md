# From conflict to collaboration

A conflict can pop up for a variety of reasons.

    - Đổi góc nhìn: thay vì trách người ta, hỏi làm sao để giúp họ giải quyết vấn đề.

1. Start a conversation
    - Tạo ra 1 khoảng timetrống để bình tĩnh
    - Đừng chỗ làm liên tục: nghỉ 1p cũng là nghỉ

1. Understand the context
    - Context = conđition of action
    - Hiểu lý do tại sao dẫn tới condition đó

# Example

1. Your supervisor gives you a new data analysis project with unclear instructions, and you become frustrated trying to figure out how to proceed.
    1. Do some additional research to better understand the context of the request.
    1. Schedule a time to ask your supervisor more questions about the big picture goals.

1. Conflict is a natural part of working on a team.
    1. Take a moment to check your emotions before engaging in an argument.
    1. Ask for a conversation to help you better understand the big picture.
